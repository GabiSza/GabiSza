- 👋 Hi, I’m @GabiSza and about a year ago I started to become interested in UX. That led me to frond-end developing which made me sign up for a Fullstack bootcamp at CodeOp in Barcelona. I have a background in economics and sociology and many years of experience in research and customer service as well.
- 👀 I’m interested in UX/UI, frontend and backend...But at this moment mainly the front. Step by step I will learn more :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, JQuery, React etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where junior developers like me can be useful.
